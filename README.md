# Board Game Data Analysis Scripts

## Project Description

This project consists of a suite of three Bash shell scripts designed to process and analyze a dataset of board games. The scripts perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and statistical analysis to answer specific research questions about board game popularity, ratings, and complexity.

## Scripts Included

This project includes the following top-level scripts:

1.  **`empty_cells`**
    *   **Purpose:** Scans a semicolon-separated data file and reports the number of empty cells found in each column. The column titles are taken from the first line of the file.
    *   **Usage:** `./empty_cells <input_filename> <separator_character>`
    *   **Example:** `./empty_cells bgg_dataset.txt ';'`
    *   **Output:** Prints a list of column titles followed by the count of empty cells in that column to standard output.
        ```
        ColumnName1: count1
        ColumnName2: count2
        ...
        ```

2.  **`preprocess`**
    *   **Purpose:** Cleans and preprocesses an input data file.
    *   **Transformations Performed:**
        1.  Converts the semicolon (`;`) separator to the TAB (`\t`) character.
        2.  Converts Microsoft line endings (`\r\n`) to Unix line endings (`\n`).
        3.  Changes the format of floating-point numbers to use `.` (period) rather than `,` (comma) as the decimal point (specifically in 'Rating Average' and 'Complexity Average' columns).
        4.  Deletes non-ASCII characters from the output.
        5.  Generates new unique integer IDs for any records with an empty ID field. New IDs are generated by finding the maximum existing numeric ID and incrementing from there.
    *   **Usage:** `./preprocess <input_filename>`
    *   **Example:** `./preprocess bgg_dataset.txt > bgg_dataset.tsv`
    *   **Output:** Sends the cleaned, tab-separated data to standard output. It is recommended to redirect this output to a new `.tsv` file.

3.  **`analysis`**
    *   **Purpose:** Takes a cleaned, tab-separated data file (output from `preprocess`) and performs analysis to answer specific research questions.
    *   **Research Questions Addressed:**
        1.  The most popular game mechanics and the number of games it's found in.
        2.  The most popular game domain and the number of games it's found in.
        3.  The Pearson correlation coefficient between the year of publication and the average rating.
        4.  The Pearson correlation coefficient between the complexity of a game and its average rating.
    *   **Usage:** `./analysis <cleaned_input_filename.tsv>`
    *   **Example:** `./analysis bgg_dataset.tsv`
    *   **Output:** Prints the answers to the research questions to standard output.
        ```
        The most popular game mechanics is [Mechanic Name] found in [X] games
        The most game domain is [Domain Name] found in [Y] games

        The correlation between the year of publication and the average rating is [Correlation_Value_1]
        The correlation between the complexity of a game and its average rating is [Correlation_Value_2]
        ```

## How to Run the Full Pipeline

1.  **Ensure scripts are executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x empty_cells preprocess analysis
    ```
2.  **Check for empty cells in the original dataset (optional initial analysis):**
    ```bash
    ./empty_cells original_data.txt ';'
    ```
3.  **Preprocess the original data to create a cleaned TSV file:**
    ```bash
    ./preprocess original_data.txt > cleaned_data.tsv
    ```
4.  **Run the analysis on the cleaned TSV file:**
    ```bash
    ./analysis cleaned_data.tsv
    ```
